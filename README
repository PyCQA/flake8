Flake8
======

Flake8 is a wrapper around these tools:

- PyFlakes
- pep8
- Ned's MacCabe script

Flake8 runs all tools by launching the single 'flake8' script, but ignores pep8
and PyFlakes extended options and just uses defaults. It displays the warnings
in a per-file, merged output.

It also adds a few features:

- files that contains with this header are skipped::

    # flake8: noqa

- lines that contains a "# NOQA" comment at the end will not issue a warning.
- a Mercurial hook.
- a McCabe complexity checker.

QuickStart
==========

To run flake8 just invoke it against any directory or Python module::

    $ flake8 coolproject
    coolproject/mod.py:1027: local variable 'errors' is assigned to but never used
    coolproject/mod.py:97: 'shutil' imported but unused
    coolproject/mod.py:729: redefinition of function 'readlines' from line 723
    coolproject/mod.py:1028: local variable 'errors' is assigned to but never used
    coolproject/mod.py:625:17: E225 missing whitespace around operato

The output of PyFlakes *and* pep8 is merged and returned.

flake8 offers an extra option: --max-complexity, which will emit a warning if the
McCabe complexityu of a function is higher that the value. By default it's 
deactivated::

    $ bin/flake8 --max-complexity 12 flake8
    coolproject/mod.py:97: 'shutil' imported but unused
    coolproject/mod.py:729: redefinition of function 'readlines' from line 723
    coolproject/mod.py:1028: local variable 'errors' is assigned to but never used
    coolproject/mod.py:625:17: E225 missing whitespace around operator
    coolproject/mod.py:452:1: 'missing_whitespace_around_operator' is too complex (18)
    coolproject/mod.py:939:1: 'Checker.check_all' is too complex (12)
    coolproject/mod.py:1204:1: 'selftest' is too complex (14)

This feature is quite useful to detect over-complex code. According to McCabe, anything
that goes beyond 10 is too complex.

Mercurial hook
==============

To use the Mercurial hook on any *commit* or *qrefresh*, change your .hg/rc file
like this::

    [hooks]
    commit = python:flake8.run.hg_hook
    qrefresh = python:flake8.run.hg_hook

    [flake8]
    strict = 0
    complexity = 12


If *strict* option is set to **1**, any warning will block the commit. When
*strict* is set to **0**, warnings are just displayed in the standard output.

*complexity* defines the maximum McCabe complexity allowed before a warning 
is emited. If you don't specify it it's just ignored. If specified, must
be a positive value. 12 is usually a good value.

Buildout integration
=====================

In order to use Flake8 inside a buildout, edit your buildout.cfg and add this::

    [buildout]
    
    parts +=
        ...
        flake8
    
    [flake8]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    eggs = flake8
           ${buildout:eggs}
    entry-points =
        flake8=flake8.run:main 

Original projects
=================

Flake8 is just a glue project, all the merits go to the creators of the original
projects:

- pep8: http://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/
- PyFlakes: http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes
- McCabe: http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200803/python_code_complexity_microtool.html
