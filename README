Flake8
======

Flake8 is a wrapper around these tools:

- PyFlakes
- pep8
- Ned's McCabe script

Flake8 runs all tools by launching the single 'flake8' script, but ignores pep8
and PyFlakes extended options and just uses defaults. It displays the warnings
in a per-file, merged output.

It also adds a few features:

- files that contains with this header are skipped::

    # flake8: noqa

- lines that contain a "# NOQA" comment at the end will not issue pyflakes 
  warnings.
- lines that contain a "# NOPEP8" comment at the end will not issue pep8 
  warnings.
- a Mercurial hook.
- a McCabe complexity checker.

QuickStart
==========

To run flake8 just invoke it against any directory or Python module::

    $ flake8 coolproject
    coolproject/mod.py:1027: local variable 'errors' is assigned to but never used
    coolproject/mod.py:97: 'shutil' imported but unused
    coolproject/mod.py:729: redefinition of function 'readlines' from line 723
    coolproject/mod.py:1028: local variable 'errors' is assigned to but never used
    coolproject/mod.py:625:17: E225 missing whitespace around operato

The output of PyFlakes *and* pep8 is merged and returned.

flake8 offers an extra option: --max-complexity, which will emit a warning if the
McCabe complexityu of a function is higher that the value. By default it's
deactivated::

    $ bin/flake8 --max-complexity 12 flake8
    coolproject/mod.py:97: 'shutil' imported but unused
    coolproject/mod.py:729: redefinition of function 'readlines' from line 723
    coolproject/mod.py:1028: local variable 'errors' is assigned to but never used
    coolproject/mod.py:625:17: E225 missing whitespace around operator
    coolproject/mod.py:452:1: 'missing_whitespace_around_operator' is too complex (18)
    coolproject/mod.py:939:1: 'Checker.check_all' is too complex (12)
    coolproject/mod.py:1204:1: 'selftest' is too complex (14)

This feature is quite useful to detect over-complex code. According to McCabe, anything
that goes beyond 10 is too complex.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity.


Mercurial hook
==============

To use the Mercurial hook on any *commit* or *qrefresh*, change your .hg/rc file
like this::

    [hooks]
    commit = python:flake8.run.hg_hook
    qrefresh = python:flake8.run.hg_hook

    [flake8]
    strict = 0
    complexity = 12


If *strict* option is set to **1**, any warning will block the commit. When
*strict* is set to **0**, warnings are just displayed in the standard output.

*complexity* defines the maximum McCabe complexity allowed before a warning
is emited. If you don't specify it it's just ignored. If specified, must
be a positive value. 12 is usually a good value.

Git hook
========

To use the Git hook on any *commit*, add a **pre-commit** file in the
*.git/hooks* directory containing::

    #!/usr/bin/python
    import sys
    from flake8.run import git_hook

    COMPLEXITY = 10
    STRICT = False

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        sys.exit(git_hook(complexity=COMPLEXITY, strict=STRICT, ignore='E501'))


If *strict* option is set to **True**, any warning will block the commit. When
*strict* is set to **False** or omited, warnings are just displayed in the
standard output.

*complexity* defines the maximum McCabe complexity allowed before a warning
is emited. If you don't specify it or set it to **-1**, it's just ignored.
If specified, it must be a positive value. 12 is usually a good value.

*lazy* when set to ``True`` will also take into account files not added to the 
index.

Also, make sure the file is executable and adapt the shebang line so it
point to your python interpreter.


Buildout integration
=====================

In order to use Flake8 inside a buildout, edit your buildout.cfg and add this::

    [buildout]

    parts +=
        ...
        flake8

    [flake8]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    eggs = flake8
           ${buildout:eggs}
    entry-points =
        flake8=flake8.run:main


setuptools integration
======================

If setuptools is available, Flake8 provides a command that checks the
Python files declared by your project. To use it, add flake8 to your
setup_requires::

    setup(
        name="project",
        packages=["project"],

        setup_requires=[
            "flake8"
        ]
    )

Running ``python setup.py flake8`` on the command line will check the
files listed in your ``py_modules`` and ``packages``. If any warnings
are found, the command will exit with an error code::

    $ python setup.py flake8
    


Original projects
=================

Flake8 is just a glue project, all the merits go to the creators of the original
projects:

- pep8: http://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/
- PyFlakes: http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes
- McCabe: http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200803/python_code_complexity_microtool.html

Warning / Error codes
=====================

Below are lists of all warning and error codes flake8 will generate, broken
out by component.
