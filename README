Flake8
======

Flake8 is a wrapper around these tools:

- PyFlakes
- pep8
- Ned's MacCabe script

Flake8 runs all tools by launching the single 'flake8' script, but ignores pep8 
and PyFlakes extended options and just uses defaults. It displays the warnings
in a per-file, merged output.

It also adds a few features:

- files that starts with this header are skipped::

    # flake8: noqa

- lines that contains a "# NOQA" comment at the end will not issue a warning
- a Mercurial hook
- more things to come..

Original projects:

- pep8: http://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/
- PyFlakes: http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes
- McCabe: http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200803/python_code_complexity_microtool.html


Mercurial hook
==============

To use the Mercurial hook on any *commit* or *qrefresh*, change your .hg/rc file
like this::

    [hooks]
    commit = python:flake8.hg_hook
    qrefresh = python:flake8.hg_hook

    [flake8]
    strict = 0


If *strict* option is set to **1**, any warning will block the commit. When
*strict* is set to **0**, warnings are just displayed in the standard output.
