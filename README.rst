Flake8 is a wrapper around these tools:

- PyFlakes
- pycodestyle
- Ned Batchelder's McCabe script

Flake8 runs all the tools by launching the single ``flake8`` command.
It displays the warnings in a per-file, merged output.

It also adds a few features:

- files that contain this line are skipped::

    # flake8: noqa

- lines that contain a ``# noqa`` comment at the end will not issue warnings.
- you can ignore specific errors on a line with ``# noqa: <error>``, e.g.,
  ``# noqa: E234``. Multiple codes can be given, separated by comma. The ``noqa`` token is case insensitive, the colon before the list of codes is required otherwise the part after ``noqa`` is ignored
- Git and Mercurial hooks
- extendable through ``flake8.extension`` and ``flake8.formatting`` entry
  points
