Flake8
======

Flake8 is a wrapper around these tools:

- PyFlakes
- pep8
- Ned Batchelder's McCabe script

Flake8 runs all the tools by launching the single ``flake8`` script.
It displays the warnings in a per-file, merged output.

It also adds a few features:

- files that contain this line are skipped::

    # flake8: noqa

- lines that contain a ``# noqa`` comment at the end will not issue warnings.
- a Git and a Mercurial hook.
- a McCabe complexity checker.
- extendable through ``flake8.extension`` entry points.


QuickStart
==========

::

    pip install flake8

To run flake8 just invoke it against any directory or Python module::

    $ flake8 coolproject
    coolproject/mod.py:97:1: F401 'shutil' imported but unused
    coolproject/mod.py:625:17: E225 missing whitespace around operato
    coolproject/mod.py:729:1: F811 redefinition of function 'readlines' from line 723
    coolproject/mod.py:1028:1: F841 local variable 'errors' is assigned to but never used

The outputs of PyFlakes *and* pep8 (and the optional plugins) are merged
and returned.

flake8 offers an extra option: --max-complexity, which will emit a warning if
the McCabe complexity of a function is higher than the value.  By default it's
deactivated::

    $ flake8 --max-complexity 12 coolproject
    coolproject/mod.py:97:1: F401 'shutil' imported but unused
    coolproject/mod.py:625:17: E225 missing whitespace around operator
    coolproject/mod.py:729:1: F811 redefinition of unused 'readlines' from line 723
    coolproject/mod.py:939:1: C901 'Checker.check_all' is too complex (12)
    coolproject/mod.py:1028:1: F841 local variable 'errors' is assigned to but never used
    coolproject/mod.py:1204:1: C901 'selftest' is too complex (14)

This feature is quite useful to detect over-complex code.  According to McCabe,
anything that goes beyond 10 is too complex.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Is flake8 broken?
-----------------

Flake8 combines two other projects that are significant on their own: pep8 and
PyFlakes. If flake8 is doing something you don't like, it is quite likely that
the problem lies in one of those other projects.  You can run them separately
to see if they are the cause of your difficulties.  We greatly appreciate your
efforts to diagnose the source of the problem before reporting bugs against
flake8.


Questions or Feedback
=====================

If you have questions you'd like to ask the developers, or feedback you'd like
to provide, feel free to use the mailing list: code-quality@python.org We
would love to hear from you. Additionally, if you have a feature you'd like to
suggest, the mailing list would be the best place for it.
