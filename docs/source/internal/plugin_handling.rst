Plugin Handling
===============

Plugin Management
-----------------

|Flake8| 3.0 added support for two other plugins besides those which define
new checks. It now supports:

- extra checks

- alternative report formatters

- listeners to auto-correct violations of checks

To facilitate this, |Flake8| needed a more mature way of managing plugins.
Thus, we developed the |PluginManager| which accepts a namespace and will load
the plugins for that namespace. A |PluginManager| creates and manages many
|Plugin| instances.

A |Plugin| lazily loads the underlying entry-point provided by setuptools.
The entry-point will be loaded either by calling
:meth:`~flake8.plugins.manager.Plugin.load_plugin` or accessing the ``plugin``
attribute. We also use this abstraction to retrieve options that the plugin
wishes to register and parse.

The only public method the |PluginManager| provides is
:meth:`~flake8.plugins.manager.PluginManager.map`. This will accept a function
(or other callable) and call it with each plugin as the first parameter.

We build atop the |PluginManager| with the |PTM|. It is expected that users of
the |PTM| will subclass it and specify the ``namespace``, e.g.,

.. code-block:: python

    class ExamplePluginType(flake8.plugin.manager.PluginTypeManager):
        namespace = 'example-plugins'

This provides a few extra methods via the |PluginManager|'s ``map`` method.

Finally, we create three classes of plugins:

- :class:`~flake8.plugins.manager.Checkers`

- :class:`~flake8.plugins.manager.Listeners`

- :class:`~flake8.plugins.manager.ReportFormatters`

These are used to interact with each of the types of plugins individually.

.. note::

    Our inspiration for our plugin handling comes from the author's extensive
    experience with ``stevedore``.

Notifying Listener Plugins
--------------------------

One of the interesting challenges with allowing plugins to be notified each
time an error or warning is emitted by a checker is finding listeners quickly
and efficiently. It makes sense to allow a listener to listen for a certain
class of warnings or just a specific warning. Hence, we need to allow all
plugins that listen to a specific warning or class to be notified. For
example, someone might register a listener for ``E1`` and another for ``E111``
if ``E111`` is triggered by the code, both listeners should be notified.
If ``E112`` is returned, then only ``E1`` (and any other listeners) would be
notified.

To implement this goal, we needed an object to store listeners in that would
allow for efficient look up - a Trie (or Prefix Tree). Given that none of the
existing packages on PyPI allowed for storing data on each node of the trie,
it was left up to write our own as :class:`~flake8._trie.Trie`. On
top of that we layer our :class:`~flake8.plugins.notifier.Notifier` class.

Now when |Flake8| receives an error or warning, we can easily call the
:meth:`~flake8.plugins.notifier.Notifier.notify` method and let plugins act on
that knowledge.

Default Plugins
---------------

Finally, |Flake8| has always provided its own plugin shim for Pyflakes. As
part of that we carry our own shim in-tree and now store that in
:mod:`flake8.plugins.pyflakes`.

|Flake8| also registers plugins for pep8. Each check in pep8 requires
different parameters and it cannot easily be shimmed together like Pyflakes
was. As such, plugins have a concept of a "group". If you look at our
:file:`setup.py` you will see that we register pep8 checks roughly like so:

.. code::

    pep8.<check-name> = pep8:<check-name>

We do this to identify that ``<check-name>>`` is part of a group. This also
enables us to special-case how we handle reporting those checks. Instead of
reporting each check in the ``--version`` output, we report ``pep8`` and check
``pep8`` the module for a ``__version__`` attribute. We only report it once
to avoid confusing users.
