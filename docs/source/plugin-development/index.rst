 Writing Plugins for Flake8
============================

Since |Flake8| 2.0, the |Flake8| tool has allowed for extensions and custom
plugins. In |Flake8| 3.0, we're expanding that ability to customize and
extend **and** we're attempting to thoroughly document it. Some of the
documentation in this section may reference third-party documentation to
reduce duplication and to point you, the developer, towards the authoritative
documentation for those pieces.
